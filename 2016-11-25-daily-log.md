ARWC pre-meeting 

CS224D lecture 14 (A.Maas)
Neural Nets in Speech Recognition


FIRST THING: how do you train an RNN?
-

input and output same data type
-> time delay


input and output different data type
-> no need for time delay

keywords
-
[`lexicon-free ASR`]
(https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/pubs/N15-1038.pdf)`character-level LM` `reduction in model complexity``beam search`



*cf.*<br/>
vanila net = single-layer feedforward network

fst is efficient in real-time decoding

CTC way: alignment-phone occurrence probability is spiky, unlike the HMM method. in CTC method, the confusing boundary information is ignored, and 'firing' is done when phone occurrence probability is highest


#RNN input & output

Each rectangle is a vector and arrows represent functions (e.g. matrix multiply). Input vectors are in red, output vectors are in blue and green vectors hold the RNN's state (more on this soon). From left to right: (1) Vanilla mode of processing without RNN, from fixed-sized input to fixed-sized output (e.g. image classification). (2) Sequence output (e.g. image captioning takes an image and outputs a sentence of words). (3) Sequence input (e.g. sentiment analysis where a given sentence is classified as expressing positive or negative sentiment). (4) Sequence input and sequence output (e.g. Machine Translation: an RNN reads a sentence in English and then outputs a sentence in French). (5) Synced sequence input and output (e.g. video classification where we wish to label each frame of the video). Notice that in every case are no pre-specified constraints on the lengths sequences because the recurrent transformation (green) is fixed and can be applied as many times as we like.

# Grand Scheme

1. Python Korean character level RNN 이해
2. make a korean word2vec system
	& train with RNN
2. do the speech -> art inversion in RNN
